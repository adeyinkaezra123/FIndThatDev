# FIndThatDev
## Github User Search 
Search and view users via the Github API - https://findthatdev.netlify.app

Requests are cached in session storage to limit the use of the API.

## What is this?

A personal project built with Vanilla Javascript, Axios and other tools to search users and
view their profiles on Github. Nothing serious.

Feel free to open issues for questions/improvements!


### API limit

The Github API has a fairly strict limit. When running the app locally you can export a [personal
access token](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens) and this will be
sent along in any API calls to increase the limit:

## TODO
- [x] Update UI
- [ ] Service worker
- [ ] Search by Keyword
